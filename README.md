> This project analysis is being conducted to know the following research questions:
> 1. Which seating arrangement outside the restaurant influences the grades?
> 2. Does the type of Alcohol permit influence the grades?
> 3. Did the restaurant's special offer such as kid meal, shareable facility, regional food, and less nutritional content influence the food inspection grading of the restaurants?
